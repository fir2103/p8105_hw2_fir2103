### Problem 1

``` r
nyc_transit <- read_csv("NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv", col_types = cols(Route8 = "c", Route9 = "c", Route10 = "c", Route11 = "c")) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(
    line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, 
    starts_with("route"), entry, exit_only, vending, entrance_type, 
    ada) %>% 
  mutate(entry = ifelse(entry == "YES", TRUE, FALSE))
```

The variables in the dataset are line, station_name, station_latitude,
station_longitude, route1, route2, route3, route4, route5, route6,
route7, route8, route9, route10, route11, entry, exit_only, vending,
entrance_type, ada. We have information about the line and station name,
along with station latitude and longitudes. The variables route1 through
route11 display different lines that go through the station, and some
examples are R, N, F, B, GS, A, C, E, Q, D, J, L, 1, G, 2, 5, FS, 3, 7,
4, 6, M, e, H. Entrance type has the values Stair, Elevator, Easement,
Escalator, Door, Ramp, Walkway. `vending` refers to if there is any
vending machine/store in the station. `ada` is a logical variable
implying whether the entry/exit is `ada` compliant. There are 1868 rows
and 20 columns.

To tidy the dataset, I cleaned the variable names (all lowercase), kept
the variables (columns) we needed through the `select` function. I
changed the `ada` variable to logical from character.

No, I do not think the dataset is tidy - the `entry` and `vending`
variable could also be changed to logical. In addition, the `route`
variable could be changed into variables for each line specifically and
be a binary variable for each. This might be easier for computation.

``` r

### Problem 2

Importing Mr. Trash Wheel dataset and tidying

``` r
mr_trash_wheel <- read_excel("Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", 
                          sheet = 1) %>% 
              janitor::clean_names()

#removed the last 3 columns in the dataset (notes columns)
#changed dumpster variable to numeric
#changed sports ball variable to rounded integer
#removed the rows where dumpster is NA (these are rows where there are notes) 
#renaming weight_tons variable and volume_cubic_yards variable

mr_trash_wheel <- mr_trash_wheel %>%
  select(dumpster:homes_powered) %>% 
  mutate(dumpster = as.numeric(dumpster), 
         sports_balls=as.integer(round(sports_balls, digits=0)), 
         year = as.numeric(year)) %>%
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  rename(weight = weight_tons, volume = volume_cubic_yards)
```

Importing Professor Trash Wheel data sheet and tidying

``` r
prof_trash_wheel <- read_excel("Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", 
                          sheet = 2) %>% janitor::clean_names()

#changed dumpster variable to numeric
#changed sports ball variable to rounded integer
#removed the rows where dumpster is NA (these are rows where there are notes) 
#renaming weight_tons variable and volume_cubic_yards variable

prof_trash_wheel <- prof_trash_wheel %>% 
  mutate(dumpster = as.numeric(dumpster), 
         sports_balls = NA, 
         year = as.numeric(year)) %>%
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  rename(weight = weight_tons, volume = volume_cubic_yards) %>% 
  relocate(sports_balls, .after = chip_bags)
```

Binding the two data frames together

``` r
#Added variable called "trash_wheel" (so we can distinguish between Mr and Professor)
mr_trash_wheel <- mr_trash_wheel %>% 
  mutate(trash_wheel="Mr Trash Wheel") 

prof_trash_wheel <- prof_trash_wheel %>% 
  mutate(trash_wheel="Professor Trash Wheel") 

#Binded rows together and arranged by descending dumpster number
#Tidied the data my rounding homes_powered to integers

trash_wheel_df <- bind_rows(
  mr_trash_wheel, prof_trash_wheel
) %>% arrange(dumpster) %>% 
  mutate(homes_powered = round(homes_powered))
```

Checking total sports balls collected by Mr. Trash Wheel in 2020

``` r
#filtering on year and Mr Trash Wheel

mr_trash_2020 <- trash_wheel_df %>% filter(year==2020 & trash_wheel=="Mr Trash Wheel")
sports_balls_2020 <- sum(mr_trash_2020$sports_balls)
```

The resulting dataset has 641 rows and 15 columns. `Dumpster` variable
is the ID variable for the dumpster. `weight` is represented in tonnes
and `volume` in cubic tonnes per yard. The variables plastic_bottles,
polystyrene, cigarette_butts, glass_bottles, grocery_bags, chip_bags,
sports_balls refers to the litter type. Dates of trash collection are
also as variables in the dataset.

-   The total weight of trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel is
    190.12.

-   The total number of sports balls collected by Mr. Trash Wheel in
    2020 is 856.

### Problem 3

Importing and tidying politicans data

``` r
pols_month <- read_csv("./fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  separate(mon, c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "-", convert = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(month=month.abb[month], 
         president=ifelse(prez_gop==1, "gop", 
                            ifelse(prez_dem==1, "dem", NA))) %>% 
  select(-c(prez_dem, prez_gop, day)) %>% 
  arrange(year, month)
```

    ## Rows: 822 Columns: 9
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## dbl  (8): prez_gop, gov_gop, sen_gop, rep_gop, prez_dem, gov_dem, sen_dem, r...
    ## date (1): mon
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

Importing and tidying `snp` data

``` r
snp <- read_csv("./fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  separate(date, c("month", "day", "year"), sep="/", convert=TRUE) %>%
  mutate(year_pref = ifelse(year<=22, 2000, 1900), 
         year = year_pref+year,
         month=month.abb[as.numeric(month)]) %>% 
  select(year, month, close) %>% 
  arrange(year, month)
```

    ## Rows: 787 Columns: 2
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (1): date
    ## dbl (1): close
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

Importing and tidying `unemployment` data

``` r
unemployment_wide <- read_csv("./fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv") 
```

    ## Rows: 68 Columns: 13
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## dbl (13): Year, Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

``` r
unemployment_long <- pivot_longer(unemployment_wide, 
    Jan:Dec, 
    names_to = "month",
    values_to = "unemployment"
  ) %>% 
  rename(year=Year)

pols_snp <- left_join(pols_month, snp, by = c("year", "month"))
pols_snp_unemp <- left_join(pols_snp, unemployment_long, by = c("year", "month"))
```

The `pols_month` data has 822 rows and 9 columns - it has information
about the numbers of politicians (president, senator, governor,
representative) who are democrats or republicans. The `snp` data has 787
rows and 3 columns - it contains information about the Standard & Poor’s
stock market index, the `close` variable which is the closing values of
the index on the given `date`. After transforming the `unemployment`
data into long-format (by putting the months into one column and
unemployment values as another variable), it has 816 rows and 3
columns - it gives the percentage of unemployment in each `month` of the
associated `year`.

The merged dataset `pols_snp_unemp` has 822 rows and 11 columns. The
range of years represented are 1947, 2015. We have unemployment data
from year 1948 and snp data from year 1950. Previous years have `NA`
values for these.
